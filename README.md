# SpotifyApp

This is a simple Angular / Node JS app.

In this App I consume the Spotify Web Api to extract profile information and statistics of Spotify users.
Since I use this api in dev mode, in order for someone to login I have to manually add this new user via the Spotify dev console.

Url of the project : https://spotify-statistics-app.herokuapp.com/

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
